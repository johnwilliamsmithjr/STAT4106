# STAT4106
John W. Smith's teaching material for STAT4106 (Theoretical Statistics II)

This material is designed for a second semester in statistical theory, for the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student. The lecture materials, found in the 'Lecture' directory were created by me, but not without inspiration. Special thanks to Dr. Bill Woodall, who both graciously shared his lecture material with me and originally taught me this course as an undergraduate many years ago. 

Topics covered include:

- Order statistics
- Moment generating functions
- Sampling distributions
- The Central Limit Theorem
- Estimators, bias, and MSE
- Interval estimation and large sample confidence intervals
- Efficiency, consistency, and sufficiency of estimators
- Exponential families
- Rao-Blackwell theorem, MVUEs, Cramer Rao Lower Bound
- Constructing estimators: method of moments, likelihood estimation, and Bayes estimators
- Hypothesis testing
- Power
- p-values
- Likelihood Ratio Tests
- Generating random samples: inverse CDF sampling and the Metropolis algorithm

Homeworks, study guides, and exams, all of which can be found in their respective directories. Many thanks to Dr. Woodall, Casella and Berger, and Wackerly et al for inspiring many of these problems, and providing a handful of them. Detailed answer keys are available upon request, but are not contained here for straightforward reasons.
